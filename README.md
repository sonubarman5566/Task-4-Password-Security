# Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand how passwords are stored using hashing, how weak passwords can be cracked, and why strong authentication mechanisms like MFA are important.

---

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- John the Ripper
- Hashcat
- rockyou.txt wordlist

---

## Task Explanation
In this task, I studied the concept of password security and authentication.  
I learned the difference between hashing and encryption, identified common hash types, and analyzed how weak passwords can be cracked using dictionary attacks.

---

## Steps Performed

1. Created a weak password (`test123`)
2. Generated SHA-256 hash of the password
3. Saved the hash in a file named `sha256hash.txt`
4. Used John the Ripper with rockyou.txt wordlist to crack the hash
5. Observed that weak passwords are easily cracked
6. Studied brute force and dictionary attacks
7. Learned about Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
